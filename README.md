# Snow Under Trees (Fabric)

*This is a continuation of the abandoned fabric port of [Snow Under Trees](https://modrinth.com/mod/snow-under-trees) which hasn't been updated since 1.17*

Adds snow under trees in snowy biomes, making the biomes more immersive.

## Config

- `enable_biome_feature` - Setting this to false will disable snow from generating under trees when new chunks are generated.
- `enable_when_snowing` - Setting this to false will disable snow from generating under trees when it is snowing in the world.
- `supported_biomes` - Any biomes whose biome IDs are in this list will have generation applied to them.
